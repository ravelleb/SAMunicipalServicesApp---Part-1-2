- Added a **Date Search** to track user searches by date.
- Continued focusing on consistent color schemes, responsive layouts, and incorporating **stacks** and **queues** for data organization.

### GPT and Other Assistance:
This project incorporates *ChatGPT*, which assisted in code refinement and overcoming technical challenges encountered during development. GPT provided solutions for bugs, UI improvements, and user engagement strategies. Gpt did not develop the application as of whole it was mostly breaking the application. 

Additionally, resources such as *Stack Overflow*, Microsoft documentation, and other coding blogs were instrumental in understanding specific C# concepts, troubleshooting errors, and finding best practices. This collaborative research approach ensured the robustness of the application.

## Future Enhancements:
1. **Service Request Status Tracking**: Enhancements to track user service requests in real-time (To be implemented in Part 3).
2. **Community Announcements**: A feature to keep citizens updated about important municipal announcements.
